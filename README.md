## THIS IS AN ABANDONED PROJECT. USE IT AS YOU WISH.
This is a python controller with no GUI. It connects to the serial port of cooja-Contiki OS, and reads the readings from the sink only.
The logic is similar to SDN, so the controller will communicate only with the sink, and the sink will convey the messages to the nodes, if and when needed.
Download the relevant \*.c code for contiki, compile a project, dont forget to open the serial port of the sink, and you should see the controller communicating with the network.
